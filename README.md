# SFT-Mk6

For info please see the earlier repos. This version was needed as the previous version was not rigid enough to prevent the magnets from sticking to the rotor. Also see my website: https://tomboy-pink.co.uk/SFT

This version is just a developmental waypoint really. I did print the parts but, again, what was achieveable with the 3D printer I have is not acurate enough to use this cog-drive system so I'm now working on Mk7, which I will set up a repo for once the design reaches that stage. You could try printing this version on a better printer but there are other difficulties with this design that never got ironed out - the magnets are positioned too close to the steel rotor axle, so there is interference from that and there is still not enough adjustment available in this configuration to get the machine set up properly. Hopefully these issues will be addressed in Mk7.
